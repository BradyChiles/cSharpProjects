 ### Halloween Superstore
  
  This program uses a database to provide the information for the display. It uses a gridview to display each of the items, much like they are in the database, but also gives option to edit and delete the items. The edits will not affect the database since it is just using a .mdf file and the only change will be for the display.
  
### Royal Inn and Suites

  This program is just a simple reservation form for a fictional hotel. It was an exercise in form validation and be able to handle requests across pages. The form will submit to a confirmation page where the previously entered information will be displayed and can then be confirmed.
  
### Price Quotation

  This program is a very simple price calculator that will take a given price and a percent discount and calculate the new price. This was also an exercise in form validation since you cannot confirm unless both fields have been filled out and calculated.
